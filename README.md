# Alarm-Light
This is a project I have been working on for my son. I am using this kit from PiMoroni https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mood-light-pi-zero-w-project-kit. I had the idea and then found out (like most things), someone had already done something similar. The original code is from https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/tanya/cute-alarm-clock.

I'm making a modified version that just does a light in the morning. Second version will tie into a Google API to read my calendar.
